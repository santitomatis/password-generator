# Password Generator
This is the final project of [Platzi's "Basic Python Course"](https://platzi.com/cursos/python/)

### Demo
When you run this script you are going to be asked the length you want your password to have

```
How long do you want your password to be? (minimun recommended: 15)
```

Once you type a number (int) and hit enter your password is going to be generated

```
How long do you want your password to be? (minimun recommended: 15) 15
Your random secure password is: ryF5gt&pZÂ°-$dYs
```

*That's pretty much all there is to it*

### What I learned
I've learned some stuff with this project, *mostly basic things but those things had to be learn a way or another*

- Array and tuples
- Use of random module
- "".join() feature


As [mentioned before](https://github.com/santitomatis/password-generator/tree/main#password-generator), this is just my version of the final project at [Platzi's course](https://platzi.com/cursos/python/)
